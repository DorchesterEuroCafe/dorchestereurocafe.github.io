<h3>How happy are you?</h3>

<p>We’re organising a street stall 11am to 1pm Saturday 23rd March 2024 in South Street, Dorchester to ask people about how they’re feeling on a range of issues, including the state of the NHS, the cost of living and the UK’s place in the world since we left the EU.</p>

<p>We’ll also be raising awareness and sharing information on related issues including the need for voter registration and ID, inding out who your local MP is and how they voted, joining the European Movement, fand, of course, coming along to Dorchester Euro Café.<p>

<p><strong>Why not come along and join us?</strong><p>

<p>If you would like to know more, please contact <a href="mailto:rachel@dorchestereurocafé.org.uk">rachel@dorchestereurocafé.org.uk</a><p>      </div>
