        <p>Dorchester Euro Café brings together people who believe that the UK should re-join the European Union</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>We’re part of cross-party campaign group Dorset for Europe and linked to the European Movement. We think that Brexit has been catastrophic for the UK and for individuals, families and businesses who now face numerous barriers to living, working, doing business and retiring in the EU</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Our monthly gatherings are warm, welcoming and social. We provide space to find support, share information, or just have a friendly chat with like-minded people</p> 
        <p></p>
        <p>We also make time to discuss various issues and – for those that want to – plan and deliver campaigning activities.</p>
